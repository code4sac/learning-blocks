### Database

To interact with the database, you can use the following commands:

- `db:push`: Pushes the database changes to the server using Drizzle Kit.
- `db:studio`: Opens the Drizzle Kit studio, a graphical interface for managing the database.
- `db:generate`: Generates database schema and types using Drizzle Kit.
- `db:migrate`: Runs database migrations using Drizzle Kit.
- `db:seed`: Seeds the database with initial data using the `seed.ts` file. Before running, a user needs to be created.
