# Test Driven Development

Test driven development (TDD) is a software development process that emphasizes writing tests before writing code. This approach helps ensure that the code is correct and that it meets the requirements of the project. The TDD process typically involves the following steps:

## UI

Test React components in the `/__tests__/unit` folder.

## Database

Test database in the `/database/__tests__/unit` folder.

Database tests are useful for adding or removing data from the database. Look at `database/__tests__/utilities` for examples.
