## Features Pattern

The Features Pattern involves organizing your application into distinct features or modules, each responsible for a
specific part of the application's functionality. This pattern helps in maintaining a clean and scalable codebase by
grouping related components, utilities, and styles together.

### Benefits

- **Modularity**: Encourages separation of concerns by grouping related functionality.
- **Scalability**: Makes it easier to add new features without affecting existing ones.
- **Maintainability**: Simplifies code management and improves readability.

### Implementing Features Pattern with Next.js Components

When implementing the Features Pattern in a Next.js project, you typically organize your components, pages, and related
files into feature-specific directories.
