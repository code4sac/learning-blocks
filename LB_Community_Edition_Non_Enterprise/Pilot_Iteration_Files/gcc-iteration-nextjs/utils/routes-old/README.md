# Routes

This application uses the [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest) library.

## Routes overview

The routes folder contains file routes. The TanStack router Vite plugin builds files in the routes directory into a file
called routeTree.gen.ts.

## router.tsx

Define route context.

### Authentication

auth.tsx

* User
* isAuthenticated

### Navigation Key

A unique identifier for pages. This can include sub menu routes and information for fetching data.

## routeTree.gen.ts

This file is automatically generated. It should be committed to source control, but not edited by hand.

## routes/__root.tsx

Root layout file. **__root.tsx file name is required.**

## routes/*.tsx

To create a new route, add a new `.tsx` file with the name of the route.

```tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute('/messages')({
    component: () => <div>
        <ExamplePage></ExamplePage>
    </div>,
    beforeLoad: async ({context, location}) => {
        if (!context.auth.isAuthenticated) {
            throw redirect({
                to: '/login',
                search: {
                    redirect: location.href,
                },
            })
        }
    },
    loader: ({context}) => {
        console.log(`DO NOT LOG THE ENTIRE CONTEXT IN PRODUCTION.\nA colorful example of logging context. %c${JSON.stringify(context)}`, `color: ${context.auth.isAuthenticated ? 'green' : 'red'}; font-weight:bold;`)
    },
})

```
