## Welcome to this open-source project dedicated to helping developers make API tools for student support service providers. The goal is for student support service providers to gain access to student informational systems. This repository has a couple of ways to do that depending on your level of expertise and depending on your intended use.

### If you are a student support service provider trying to use these tools, please read [this documentation](https://github.com/code4sac/learning-blocks/blob/main/Documentation%20Directory/SSSP_Read_Me.md) However, you will need to reach out to your LEA's Database Coordinator for the following information:

- API KEY
- Aeries School Code
- Target student's Aeries STU.ID field
